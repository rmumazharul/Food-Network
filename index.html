            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Clare Smyth was the head chef at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay from 2012 to 2016 and Britain’s first female chef to run a restaurant with three Michelin stars until she opened her first restaurant, Core, in 2017. Clare won the Chef of the Year award in 2013 and achieved a perfect score in the 2015 edition of the Good Food Guide. Achieving that position is a great accomplishment in itself. However, Clare’s attitude of perseverance and passion to be successful in a man’s world is what demonstrated her determination to not let her gender limit her success.</p>

            <p>Cool and creamy, sorbets are the ultimate light summer treat.  They're not only super refreshing (and palate cleansing), but are also some of the easiest frozen desserts to make.  Since most sorbets do not contain any dairy (with a few rare exceptions), they make a delightful alternative to ice cream for the dairy-free folks in your group.  From  and  to  and , these sorbet recipes showcase the versatility of this simple frozen treat.</p>

            <h2>Vegetables</h2>
            <p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition.</p>

            <h2>Salads</h2>
            <p>The healthiest salads start with dark leafy greens and incorporate vibrant colored vegetables and/or fruit. Healthy salads may also contain grains like quinoa or nuts. A healthy salad has a dressing that's not loaded with large amounts of oil, mayonnaise or other type of fat.</p>
